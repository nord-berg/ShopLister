<!-- This is a really hacky way of showing a line at the top of the view.
	It basically draws a 3dp rectangle around the whole view, and uses 
	layer-list to set the boundry of the drawable to 3dp bigger than the view
	on all sides except the top.
	The alternative would've been to add an additional view to my layout,
	but that had the potential to mess up my layout. -->
